Hayastan, IPA: [hɑjɑsˈtɑn][a]), officially the Republic of Armenia (Armenian: Հայաստանի Հանրապետություն, tr. Hayastani Hanrapetut’yun), is a sovereign state in the South Caucasus region of Eurasia. Located in Western Asia,[17][18] it is bordered by Turkey to the west, Georgia to the north, the de facto independent Nagorno-Karabakh Republic and Azerbaijan to the east, and Iran and the Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhchivan to the south.\r\n\r\nArmenia is a unitary, multi-party, democratic nation-state with an ancient cultural heritage. The Kingdom of Van was established in 860 BC and by the 6th century BC it was replaced by the Satrapy of Armenia. In the 1st century BC the Kingdom of Armenia reached its height under Tigranes the Great. Armenia became the first state in the world to adopt Christianity as its official religion.[19] In between the late 3rd century to early years of the 4th century, the state became the first Christian nation.[20][21][22] The official date of state adoption of Christianity is 301 AD.[23] The ancient Armenian kingdom was split between the Byzantine and Sasanid empires around the early 5th century. Under the Bagratuni dynasty, the Armenian Kingdom was restored in the 9th century. Declining due to the wars against the Byzantines, the kingdom fell in 1045 and Armenia was soon after invaded by the Seljuk Turks. An Armenian principality and later a kingdom Cilician Armenia was located on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea between the 11th and 14th centuries.','https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenia'),(2,'Russia','Russia (Listeni/ˈrʌʃə/; Russian: Росси́я, tr.

Rossiyskaya Federatsiya; IPA: [rɐˈsʲijskəjə fʲɪdʲɪˈratsɨjə] ( listen)), is a sovereign state in northern Eurasia.[12] It is a federal semi-presidential republic. At 17,125,200 square kilometres (6,612,100 sq mi),[13] Russia is the largest country in the world, covering more than one-eighth of the Earth\'s inhabited land area.[14][15][16] Russia is the world\'s ninth most populous country with over 144 million people at the end of 2015.[5][6]\r\n\r\nExtending across the entirety of northern Asia and much of Eastern Europe, Russia spans eleven time zones and incorporates a wide range of environments and landforms. From northwest to southeast, Russia shares land borders with Norway, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland (both with Kaliningrad Oblast), Belarus, Ukraine, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, China, Mongolia, and North Korea. It shares maritime borders with Japan by the Sea of Okhotsk and the U.S. state of Alaska across the Bering Strait.','https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia'),(3,'USA','The United States of America (commonly referred to as the United States, U.S., USA, or America), is a federal republic composed of 50 states, a federal district of Washington, D,C., five major territories, and various possessions.[fn 1] The 48 contiguous states and Washington, D.C., are in central North America between Canada and Mexico. The state of Alaska is in the northwestern part of North America and the state of Hawaii is an archipelago in the mid-Pacific. The territories are scattered about the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. At 3.8 million square miles (9.9 million km2)[18] and with over 320 million people, the country is the world\'s third largest by total area (fourth largest by land area)[fn 2] and the third most populous. It is one of the world\'s most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration from many countries.[24] The geography and climate of the United States are also extremely diverse, and the country is home to a wide variety of wildlife.[25]','https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States'),(4,'Putin','Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin (/ˈpuːtɪn/; Russian: Влади́мир Влади́мирович Пу́тин; IPA: [vlɐˈdʲimʲɪr vlɐˈdʲimʲɪrəvʲɪtɕ ˈputʲɪn] ( listen), born 7 October 1952) has been the President of Russia since 7 May 2012, succeeding Dmitry Medvedev. Putin served as prime minister from 1999 to 2000, as president from 2000 to 2008, and again as prime minister from 2008 to 2012. During Putin\'s second term as prime minister, he was the Chairman of the United Russia Party, the ruling party.\r\n\r\nPutin was an officer in the KGB for 16 years, rising to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel, before retiring in 1991 to enter politics in his native Saint Petersburg. Putin moved to Moscow in 1996, and joined President Boris Yeltsin\'s administration, where he rose quickly through the ranks, becoming Acting President on 31 December 1999, when Yeltsin resigned. Putin won the subsequent 2000 Presidential election by a 52% to 30% margin, thus avoiding a runoff with his Communist Party opponent, Gennady Zyuganov.[2] Putin was reelected in 2004, with 72% of the vote.\r\n\r\nBecause of constitutionally mandated term limits, Putin was ineligible to run for a third consecutive presidential term in 2008. Dmitry Medvedev won the 2008 Presidential election, and appointed Putin to be the Prime Minister, beginning a period of so-called \"tandemocracy\".[3] In September 2011, following a change in the law that extended presidential terms from four year to six years,[4] Putin announced he would seek a third term in the 2012 Presidential election. Putin won the March 2012 election with 64% of the vote, a result which aligned with pre-election polling.[5] Opposition groups accused Putin and his United Russia party of fraud.[6][7]\r\n\r\nDuring Putin\'s first presidency, the Russian economy grew for eight straight years and GDP measured in purchasing power increased 72%.[8][9][10][11][12] This growth was a result of the 2000s commodities boom, high oil prices, and prudent economic and fiscal policies.[13][14] However, the economy began to experience difficulties with the arrival of the global economic crisis of 2008-2009,[15] falling oil prices and, beginning in 2014, Western sanctions imposed after Russia\'s annexation of Crimea and military intervention in Eastern Ukraine, with GDP shrinking by 3.7% in 2015.[8][13][14][16][17][18]','https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin'),(5,'Obama','President Obama announced his Supreme Court nominee, Judge Merrick Garland.
